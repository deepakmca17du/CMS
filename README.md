## Project Description
<p>Content Management System is a Blog Post Web Application that can be the
   unified platform for the University students to write Blogs relating to
   different subjects or topics that they are majoring in or otherwise based on
   their interests, also giving them an opportunity to showcase their piece of
   work to the larger audience as compared to the current system wherein their
   work gets published only in the college magazines and gets limited to the
   individual colleges or departments.
